            I am so confused what to write here so i am putting this random text
            to fill the space and practice my skills.

            I am pretty sure i know enough <code>HTML</code> to create any
            website i want to 😇

            Ummm.. I am not a pro of <code>CSS</code> but i know basics of it
            and i can make a website somewhat responsive using flexbox 😌

            I am just lying 🤥. I mean u can count this as a skill if u think
            making commits and pushing it to
            <a href="https://github.com/taraksh01/">github</a> is a skill 🙃

          <p>
            It's interesting, i recently learned <code>java</code> and i liked it. Don't tell anyone i hated
            java in my college days because of its large syntax 🤫

        I don't know why i put it here. Anyways i am going to tell u something i
        am slowly becoming social and now i feel comfortabel talking with
        strangers. I talk to people online in my free time but i still don't
        know how to start a conversation as i feel lil afraid to introduce
        myself before knowing with whom i am talking to, maybe this is because i
        can't see the person
